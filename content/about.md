## Who am I?

My name is Brian DeVries. I help small businesses keep their websites updated and looking fresh. I've been developing websites since February 2019 and I haven't looked back. Helping others get their piece of the web looking the way they want excites me! If you're a small business owner in need of a website or have a website that needs updates, I can help you.

## What I can do for you

I work as a web developer known as _The Tech Carpenter_. I specialize in building websites for small businesses that want to increase their visibility with their very own web presence. However, I also make updates for existing websites.

**You're in the right place if you face any of the following problems:**

- You own a small business, don't have a website, and need a website created.
- You need your website updated and don't know where to start.
- Something on your site doesn't look right or isn't working.
- You need some additions to your website.

By working with me, you can ensure that your website will be functional and updated.

## How I Got Here

I have enjoyed learning how to use technology since my youth. However, I also have a desire to create things that are visually appealing. This combination has brought me to where I am today.

## The Electric Beginning

In the fall of 2013, I began studying electrical engineering at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Electricity fascinated me and I followed electrical concepts fairly well. While I was there, I took an _Introduction to Programming_ course that got me hooked on software. However, I was committed to becoming an electrical engineer so I continued on that path despite my newfound interest. In May 2017, I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering.

I worked for about 1 year managing a circuit board manufacturing line at [Gentex Corporation][gentex] before I received the offer to work as a Test Engineer with the same company. This position allowed me to use my electrical engineering knowledge while building up my software knowledge.

## Website Development Enters the Scene

A few months after the start of my new Test Engineer position, I was assigned the project that aquainted me with the world of website development. My team had an internal website that needed some updates. I didn't have much web programming experience at the time, but I dove in and learned what I could from the existing code. I started tweaking things to see what I could do. I lost track of time making changes to the website.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em;"><em>I was hooked on web development.</em></p>

From then on, I looked for opportunities to excercise my web programming skills both at work and at home. I worked through some online courses to learn the basics and the rest is history. Now I am adding value by building websites for businesses.

## Now Let's Get Personal

I'm the oldest of 4 kids. I grew up in Colorado, but I now reside near Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I love building things and I have a craftsmanship mindset. Namely, I enjoy making handles for hand tools, working with wood, and building things using my carpentry skills (furniture, toys, etc.).

I am a disciple of Christ. My faith is an integral part of who I am and infiltrates the work I do for others. I am grateful for the gifts God has given me and I strive to steward them well.

That's a pretty good summary of who I am. ðŸ™‚ I look forward to working with you on your very own website!
