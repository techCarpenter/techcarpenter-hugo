I build lightweight, secure websites for small businesses.

Most small business websites don't require **the majority** of what site hosting services such as Wordpress offer. Solutions like Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace, etc. come with a lot of overhead that slows down your site and in some cases makes it less secure.

The technologies that I use to build websites are lightweight and require minimal developer maintenance so you can edit your content, minimize the overall operating cost of your website, and improve your site's performance.

## Website Creation

I build websites that are:

- **High performing**: Static sites are _FAST_. Quick build, quick site fetching
- **Secure**: Static sites have fewer vulnerabilities (no databases)
- **Easy to use and update**: Lightweight Content Management System
- **Modern and Responsive**: Mobile-friendly
